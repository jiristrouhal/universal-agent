# Initial idea

The aim of this repo is to re-implement the Voyager-like AI system, that is capable of understanding of how a given system works, learn how to control it and then being able to fulfill various tasks given by a user.

In general, the system must be able to distinguish between being prompted to explore and learn and just focus on fulfilling tasks as reliably as possible. When controlling, the system will, however, remember all eventual failures and surprises and store them for learning.
